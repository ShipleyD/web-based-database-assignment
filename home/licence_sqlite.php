--------------------------------------------------------------------
			SQLite Copyright
--------------------------------------------------------------------

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been dedicated to the 
public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives 
of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating 
their contributions to the public domain and originals of those 
signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of 
Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, 
or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form 
or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or 
non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code in SQLite 
- those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship 
with a larger application. Portions of the documentation and some code 
used as part of the build process might fall under other licenses. The 
details here are unclear. We do not worry about the licensing of the 
documentation and build code so much because none of these things are 
part of the core deliverable SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. 
No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. 
Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all 
of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite 
code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other 
projects.

Obtaining An Explicit License To Use SQLite

Even though SQLite is in the public domain and does not require a 
license, some users want to obtain a license anyway. Some reasons for 
obtaining a license include:

    * You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize 
	the public domain.
    * You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize 
	the right of an author to dedicate their work to the public domain.
    * You want to hold a tangible legal document as evidence that you 
	have the legal right to use and distribute SQLite.
    * Your legal department tells you that you have to purchase a 
	license.

If you feel like you really have to purchase a license for SQLite, Hwaci, 
the company that employs the architect and principal developers of SQLite, 
will sell you one.

Contributed Code

In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright, 
all new contributors to the SQLite code base are asked to dedicate their 
contributions to the public domain. If you want to send a patch or 
enhancement for possible inclusion in the SQLite source tree, please 
accompany the patch with the following statement:

    The author or authors of this code dedicate any and all copyright 
	interest in this code to the public domain. We make this dedication 
	for the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of our 
	heirs and successors. We intend this dedication to be an overt act 
	of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights to 
	this code under copyright law. 

We are not able to accept patches or changes to SQLite that are not 
accompanied by a statement such as the above. In addition, if you make 
changes or enhancements as an employee, then a simple statement such as 
the above is insufficient. You must also send by surface mail a copyright 
release signed by a company officer. A signed original of the copyright 
release should be mailed to:
    Hwaci
    6200 Maple Cove Lane
    Charlotte, NC 28269
    USA
